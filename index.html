<!-- I knew you would check for things like this. I would, too.
Since I knew some players would try to go to this site, it had to have something on it.
This is just a little easter egg for those people (and the only time my fourth-wall-breaking will be this blatant).
Thank you for playing. I hope you're having fun. Tell your friends!
